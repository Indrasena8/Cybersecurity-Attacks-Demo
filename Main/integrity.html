          Integrity is the property that information has not been altered or
          changed in an unauthorized manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples include files, texts, videos, Tiktok clips, Instagram posts.

        <p>
          Data that has been tampered with has lost its integrity. (It can be
          violated through modifying configuration, changing system logs to
          avoid detection, human error, etc.)
        </p>

      <h2>Methods to Ensure Integrity</h2>

      <h3>Backups</h3>
      <div class="content-section">
        <p>
          Backups: The method ensures that the information originated from the
          signer and was not altered, and also proves the identity of the
          organization that created the digital signature. (Similar to
          encryption but the key does not encrypt the information).
        </p>
        <p>
          This method produces a digital signature (a code) using the
          information. After sending, the receiver then checks if the signature
          matches with the information sent.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Checksums</h3>
      <img src="img/in5.png" alt="Checksums Illustration" class="content-image" />
      <div class="content-section">
        <p>
          Checksums (hash functions): The computation of a function that maps
          the contents of a file into an alphanumeric value. Even the slightest
          change in a file can result in different output values, making it
          easier to spot if a piece of info has been altered.
